## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   As a User

        1. I want to quickly understand the game.
        2. I want to be able to see my score as the game progresses.
        3. I want to be able to mute the sound. 
        4. I want to be able to play against the computer.
        5. I want to be entertained by the simplicity of the game and its quirky design.
        6. I want to be able to play the game on both mobile phone and computer.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours are red and light blue. I was going for a childlike and very simple design, with soft pastel colors. The red and the light blue also suited the charcters well.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Arial font is the main font used, as it suited the colors and the design really well. It is also clean and simple.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Getting the right imagary was important and took a lot of searching. I wanted to create a funny and quirky game with funny looking chracters, rather than the usual approach. As soon as I found these, I knew they were perfect for the vibe I was going for. The aim is to put a smile on the face of the user.

         #### Sound
        -   I chose a sound that should remind the user of classic 8bit audio games.
